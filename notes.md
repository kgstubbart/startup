## HTML Notes

I learned that without CSS, paragraph spacing is difficult to work with. Sometimes there are ways around it, such as span tags, but the p tag didn't really work. Making sure to get spacing right is important, which I had to deal with a bit for my buttons to make suure they weren't located in a weird spot.
