## CSS Notes

Bootstrap is very useful if you are going for a singular design, it gets a bit harder to use if you want more freedom. For example, I wanted the My Ace button to match the color scheme to the website, meaning I had to custom design that button yet match it to the bootstrap buttons I had used. Poeple notice slight changes, so I made sure to even get the hover color similar in shade difference. Some CSS items are very easy to carry over between pages, and add much better visual appeal to the site.

## HTML Notes

I learned that without CSS, paragraph spacing is difficult to work with. Sometimes there are ways around it, such as span tags, but the p tag didn't really work. Making sure to get spacing right is important, which I had to deal with a bit for my buttons to make suure they weren't located in a weird spot.
